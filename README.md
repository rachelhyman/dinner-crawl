About

The beginnings of an app to guide people on a dinner tour. The place annotation features an image and tapping the info button brings up a large version of the image in the top left (that's my friend's corgi). 

Dependencies

-Kiwi/XCTest
-Mapbox

What I Learned

I played around with the Mapbox iOS SDK and did TDD with Kiwi.
